        <p>
          There are not many examples of “fair” gerrymandering, or
          gerrymandering of a state that is representative of the beliefs of its
          constituents. So, ask yourself, how do we get “fair” gerrymandering,
          and what might stand in the way? If you are particularly interested in
          this topic, make sure to visit our Getting Involved page.
